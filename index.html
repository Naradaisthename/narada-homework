		<p>You may ask yourself, how are those fancy coders able to remember all those things? Surely if you forget them, you can't do much? Well luckily for us, our brains are wired to remember lots of things. In fact, right now you are passively remembering this website, through a series of visual stimuli.</p>
	
		<p>The secret to remembering code is a passive one. Many of the famous coders you know about don't actually memorise the code they right. What happens is that as they learn more about the code, the more they remember it. When starting out, the fundamental rules of coding may seem a bit daunting. However, as you continue to learn more languages, the more code you can actually write. It is strange when you write your first bits of code, because it seems like you have studied it when in fact it is just your memory kicking in. Take this website for example. The way I wrote it is strange because I haven't actually looked at tutorials in months. However, I seem to just know how to do it because of my memory.</p>
	
		<p>So, I can tell you that it is relatively easy to pick up, with the correct resources at hand. I would highly recommend going onto CodeCademy to start learning, which can be found by clicking on the link below. They provide in-depth, interactive courses, all for free! So go ahead and get over there.</p>

		<p>For starters, it really depends on what type of person you are. If you're the kind of guy that prefers the quickest option or isn't great at proof reading your work, you are likely to not get much fufilment from programming. It takes months to get to a level where you are competent at coding, years to make real, significant progress for others to see. The issue is that when you solve one problem, more tend to arise. At this stage, it is rather irritating to get that compile error or a result different from what you thought you put in. This is why coding can really out people off, mainly due to how many things you have to do in order to get to do the simplest of tasks.</p>
		
		<p>However, those who do continue to further their understanding into computers will find the benefits. You can take me for example. After pushing through courses, such as codecademy and cs50, I found that the way I looked at things had changed. I could see a problem and think multiple ways, in code, to solve it. It is quite satisfying, and I have had fun doing other projects like making this website. So, yes, I believe that coding, if you strive and push through the problems that you will find, it can be really rewarding.</p>
